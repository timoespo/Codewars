      The first input array is the key to the correct answers to an exam, like
      ["a", "a", "b", "d"]. The second one contains a student's submitted
      answers. The two arrays are not empty and are the same length. Return the
      score for this array of answers, giving +4 for each correct answer, -1 for
      each incorrect answer, and +0 for each blank answer, represented as an
      empty string (in C the space character is used). If the score &lt; 0,
      return 0.
