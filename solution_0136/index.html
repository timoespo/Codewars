    <p>
      Story Your online store likes to give out coupons for special occasions.
      Some customers try to cheat the system by entering invalid codes or using
      expired coupons. Task Your mission: Write a function called checkCoupon
      which verifies that a coupon code is valid and not expired. A coupon is no
      more valid on the day AFTER the expiration date. All dates will be passed
      as strings in this format: "MONTH DATE, YEAR".
