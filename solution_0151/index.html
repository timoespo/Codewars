    <p>
      This program tests the life of an evaporator containing a gas. We know the
      content of the evaporator (content in ml), the percentage of foam or gas
      lost every day (evap_per_day) and the threshold (threshold) in percentage
      beyond which the evaporator is no longer useful. All numbers are strictly
      positive. The program reports the nth day (as an integer) on which the
      evaporator will be out of use.
