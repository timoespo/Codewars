    <title>Codewars Solution 0220 - Take a Ten Minute Walk</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      You live in the city of Cartesia where all roads are laid out in a perfect
      grid. You arrived ten minutes too early to an appointment, so you decided
      to take the opportunity to go for a short walk. The city provides its
      citizens with a Walk Generating App on their phones -- everytime you press
      the button it sends you an array of one-letter strings representing
      directions to walk (eg. ['n', 's', 'w', 'e']). You always walk only a
      single block for each letter (direction) and you know it takes you one
      minute to traverse one city block, so create a function that will return
      true if the walk the app gives you will take you exactly ten minutes (you
      don't want to be early or late!) and will, of course, return you to your
      starting point. Return false otherwise
