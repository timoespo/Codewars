    <title>Codewars Solution 0185 - Lost Number in Number Sequence</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      An ordered sequence of numbers from 1 to N is given. One number might have
      deleted from it, then the remaining numbers were mixed. Find the number
      that was deleted. Example: The starting array sequence is
      [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] The mixed array with one deleted number is
      [3,2,4,6,7,8,1,9] Your function should return the int 5. If no number was
      deleted from the starting array, your function should return the int 0.
      Note: N may be 1 or less (in the latter case, the first array will be []).
