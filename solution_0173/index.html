    <p>
      Consider the word "abode". We can see that the letter a is in position 1
      and b is in position 2. In the alphabet, a and b are also in positions 1
      and 2. Notice also that d and e in abode occupy the positions they would
      occupy in the alphabet, which are positions 4 and 5.
