      Codewars Solution 0308 - Reverse every other word in the string
    </title>

    <p>
      Reverse every other word in a given string, then return the string. Throw
      away any leading or trailing whitespace, while ensuring there is exactly
      one space between each word. Punctuation marks should be treated as if
      they are a part of the word in this kata.
