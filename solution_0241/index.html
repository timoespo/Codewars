      Alice and Bob were on a holiday. Both of them took many pictures of the
      places they've been, and now they want to show Charlie their entire
      collection. However, Charlie doesn't like these sessions, since the motif
      usually repeats. He isn't fond of seeing the Eiffel tower 40 times. He
      tells them that he will only sit for the session if they show the same
      motif at most N times. Luckily, Alice and Bob are able to encode the motif
      as a number. Can you help them to remove numbers such that their list
      contains each number only up to N times, without changing the order?
