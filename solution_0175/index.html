      In John's car the GPS records every s seconds the distance travelled from
      an origin (distances are measured in an arbitrary but consistent unit).
      For example, below is part of a record with s = 15: x = [0.0, 0.19, 0.5,
      0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2.0, 2.25] The sections are: 0.0-0.19,
      0.19-0.5, 0.5-0.75, 0.75-1.0, 1.0-1.25, 1.25-1.50, 1.5-1.75, 1.75-2.0,
      2.0-2.25 We can calculate John's average hourly speed on every section and
      we get: [45.6, 74.4, 60.0, 60.0, 60.0, 60.0, 60.0, 60.0, 60.0] Given s and
      x the task is to return as an integer the *floor* of the maximum average
      speed per hour obtained on the sections of x. If x length is less than or
      equal to 1 return 0 since the car didn't move.
