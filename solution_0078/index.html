      The Collatz conjecture (also known as 3n+1 conjecture) is a conjecture
      that applying the following algorithm to any number we will always
      eventually reach one: [This is writen in pseudocode] if(number is even)
      number = number / 2 if(number is odd) number = 3*number + 1 <br />#Task
      Your task is to make a function hotpo that takes a positive n as input and
      returns the number of times you need to perform this algorithm to get n =
      1. <br />#Examples hotpo(1) returns 0 (1 is already 1) hotpo(5) returns 5
      5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 hotpo(6) returns 8 6 -> 3 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 ->
      8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 hotpo(23) returns 15 23 -> 70 -> 35 -> 106 -> 53 -> 160
      -> 80 -> 40 -> 20 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
