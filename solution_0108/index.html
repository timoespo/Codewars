  </head>

    <p>
      Don't give me five! In this kata you get the start number and the end
      number of a region and should return the count of all numbers except
      numbers with a 5 in it. The start and the end number are both inclusive!
      Examples: 1,9 -> 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9 -> Result 8 4,17 ->
      4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,16,17 -> Result 12 The result may contain fives.
      ;-) The start number will always be smaller than the end number. Both
      numbers can be also negative!
