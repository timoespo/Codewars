    <p>
      Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only
      your friends name in it. If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be
      sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's
      not... Ex: Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"], Output = ["Ryan",
      "Yous"]
