    <p>
      Your car is old, it breaks easily. The shock absorbers are gone and you
      think it can handle about 15 more bumps before it dies totally.
      Unfortunately for you, your drive is very bumpy! Given a string showing
      either flat road (_) or bumps (n). If you are able to reach home safely by
      encountering 15 bumps or less, return Woohoo!, otherwise return Car Dead
