    <p>It's bonus time in the big city! The fatcats are rubbing their paws in anticipation... but who is going to make the most money?

        Build a function that takes in two arguments (salary, bonus). Salary will be an integer, and bonus a boolean.
        
        If bonus is true, the salary should be multiplied by 10. If bonus is false, the fatcat did not make enough money and must receive only his stated salary.</p>
