      Given an array of ones and zeroes, convert the equivalent binary value to
      an integer. Eg: [0, 0, 0, 1] is treated as 0001 which is the binary
      representation of 1. Examples: Testing: [0, 0, 0, 1] ==> 1 Testing: [0, 0,
      1, 0] ==> 2 Testing: [0, 1, 0, 1] ==> 5 Testing: [1, 0, 0, 1] ==> 9
      Testing: [0, 0, 1, 0] ==> 2 Testing: [0, 1, 1, 0] ==> 6 Testing: [1, 1, 1,
      1] ==> 15 Testing: [1, 0, 1, 1] ==> 11 However, the arrays can have
      varying lengths, not just limited to 4.
