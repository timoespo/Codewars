    <title>Codewars Solution 0123 - Two Fighters, One Winner</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      Each fighter takes turns attacking the other and whoever kills the other
      first is victorious. Death is defined as having health &lt;;= 0. Each
      fighter will be a Fighter object/instance. See the Fighter class below in
      your chosen language. Both health and damagePerAttack (damage_per_attack
      for python) will be integers larger than 0. You can mutate the Fighter
      objects. Your function also receives a third argument, a string, with the
      name of the fighter that attacks first.
