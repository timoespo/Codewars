      Codewars Solution 0124 - Adding Values of Arrays In a Shifted Way
    </title>

    <p>
      Adding values of arrays in a shifted way You have to write a method, that
      gets two parameter: 1. An array of arrays with int-numbers 2. The shifting
      value #The method should add the values of the arrays to one new array.
      The arrays in the array will all have the same size and this size will
      always be greater than 0. The shifting value is always a value from 0 up
      to the size of the arrays. There are always arrays in the array, so you do
      not need to check for null or empty.
