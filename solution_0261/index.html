    <title>Codewars Solution 0261 - Give me a Diamond</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      Jamie is a programmer, and James' girlfriend. She likes diamonds, and
      wants a diamond string from James. Since James doesn't know how to make
      this happen, he needs your help. Task You need to return a string that
      looks like a diamond shape when printed on the screen, using asterisk (*)
      characters. Trailing spaces should be removed, and every line must be
      terminated with a newline character (\n). Return null/nil/None/... if the
      input is an even number or negative, as it is not possible to print a
      diamond of even or negative size.
