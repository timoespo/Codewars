  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      Complete the function that takes two numbers as input, num and nth and
      return the nth digit of num (counting from right to left). Note If num is
      negative, ignore its sign and treat it as a positive value If nth is not
      positive, return -1 Keep in mind that 42 = 00042. This means that
      findDigit(42, 5) would return 0
