    <title>Codewars Solution 0093 - Printing Errors</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. For one kind of boxes the
      printer has to use colors which, for the sake of simplicity, are named
      with letters from a to m. The colors used by the printer are recorded in a
      control string. For example a "good" control string would be
      aaabbbbhaijjjm meaning that the printer used three times color a, four
      times color b, one time color h then one time color a... Sometimes there
      are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a "bad" control
      string is produced e.g. aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm with letters not from a to
      m. You have to write a function printer_error which given a string will
      return the error rate of the printer as a string representing a rational
      whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length of
      the control string. Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.
      The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters
      from ato z.
