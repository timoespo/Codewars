    <title>Codewars Solution 0230 - Equal Sides Of An Array</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      You are going to be given an array of integers. Your job is to take that
      array and find an index N where the sum of the integers to the left of N
      is equal to the sum of the integers to the right of N. If there is no
      index that would make this happen, return -1.
