    <title>Codewars Solution 0114 - Sort Array by String Length</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      Write a function that takes an array of strings as an argument and returns
      a sorted array containing the same strings, ordered from shortest to
      longest. For example, if this array were passed as an argument:
      ["Telescopes", "Glasses", "Eyes", "Monocles"] Your function would return
      the following array: ["Eyes", "Glasses", "Monocles", "Telescopes"] All of
      the strings in the array passed to your function will be different
      lengths, so you will not have to decide how to order multiple strings of
      the same length.
