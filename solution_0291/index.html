    <title>Codewars Solution 0291 - Are they the "same"</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      Given two arrays a and b write a function comp(a, b) (orcompSame(a, b))
      that checks whether the two arrays have the "same" elements, with the same
      multiplicities (the multiplicity of a member is the number of times it
      appears). "Same" means, here, that the elements in b are the elements in a
      squared, regardless of the order.
