    <title>Codewars Solution 0086 - Credit Card Mask</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      Usually when you buy something, you're asked whether your credit card
      number, phone number or answer to your most secret question is still
      correct. However, since someone could look over your shoulder, you don't
      want that shown on your screen. Instead, we mask it. Your task is to write
      a function maskify, which changes all but the last four characters into
      '#'.
