    <title>Codewars Solution 0260 - Title Case</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      A string is considered to be in title case if each word in the string is
      either (a) capitalised (that is, only the first letter of the word is in
      upper case) or (b) considered to be an exception and put entirely into
      lower case unless it is the first word, which is always capitalised. Write
      a function that will convert a string into title case, given an optional
      list of exceptions (minor words). The list of minor words will be given as
      a string with each word separated by a space. Your function should ignore
      the case of the minor words string -- it should behave in the same way
      even if the case of the minor word string is changed.
