    <p>
      A bookseller has lots of books classified in 26 categories labeled A, B,
      ... Z. Each book has a code c of 3, 4, 5 or more characters. The 1st
      character of a code is a capital letter which defines the book category.
      In the bookseller's stocklist each code c is followed by a space and by a
      positive integer n (int n >= 0) which indicates the quantity of books of
      this code in stock.
