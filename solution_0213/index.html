    <title>Codewars Solution 0213 - Help the Fruit Guy</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      Our fruit guy has a bag of fruit (represented as an array of strings)
      where some fruits are rotten. He wants to replace all the rotten pieces of
      fruit with fresh ones. For example, given ["apple","rottenBanana","apple"]
      the replaced array should be ["apple","banana","apple"]. Your task is to
      implement a method that accepts an array of strings containing fruits
      should returns an array of strings where all the rotten fruits are
      replaced by good ones.
