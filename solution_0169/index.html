    <title>Codewars Solution 0169 - Palindrom Chain Length</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      Number is a palindrome if it is equal to the number with digits in
      reversed order. For example, 5, 44, 171, 4884 are palindromes, and 43,
      194, 4773 are not. Write a function which takes a positive integer and
      returns the number of special steps needed to obtain a palindrome. The
      special step is: "reverse the digits, and add to the original number". If
      the resulting number is not a palindrome, repeat the procedure with the
      sum until the resulting number is a palindrome. If the input number is
      already a palindrome, the number of steps is 0. All inputs are guaranteed
      to have a final palindrome which does not overflow
