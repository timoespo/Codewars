    <title>Codewars Solution 0112 - Breaking Chocolate</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      Your task is to split the chocolate bar of given dimension n x m into
      small squares. Each square is of size 1x1 and unbreakable. Implement a
      function that will return minimum number of breaks needed. For example if
      you are given a chocolate bar of size 2 x 1 you can split it to single
      squares in just one break, but for size 3 x 1 you must do two breaks. If
      input data is invalid you should return 0 (as in no breaks are needed if
      we do not have any chocolate to split). Input will always be a
      non-negative integer.
