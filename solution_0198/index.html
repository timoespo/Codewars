    <title>Codewars Solution 0198 - Invite More Women?</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      King Arthur and his knights are having a New Years party. Last year
      Lancelot was jealous of Arthur, because Arthur had a date and Lancelot did
      not, and they started a duel. To prevent this from happening again, Arthur
      wants to make sure that there are at least as many women as men at this
      year's party. He gave you a list of integers of all the party goers.
      Arthur needs you to return true if he needs to invite more women or false
      if he is all set.
