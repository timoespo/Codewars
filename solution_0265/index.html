    <title>Codewars Solution 0265 - Reverse of Rotate?</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      The input is a string str of digits. Cut the string into chunks (a chunk
      here is a substring of the initial string) of size sz (ignore the last
      chunk if its size is less than sz). If a chunk represents an integer such
      as the sum of the cubes of its digits is divisible by 2, reverse that
      chunk; otherwise rotate it to the left by one position. Put together these
      modified chunks and return the result as a string.
