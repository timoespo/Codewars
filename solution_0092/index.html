    <title>Codewars Solution 0092 - Find the next perfect square</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      You might know some pretty large perfect squares. But what about the NEXT
      one? Complete the findNextSquare method that finds the next integral
      perfect square after the one passed as a parameter. Recall that an
      integral perfect square is an integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an
      integer. If the parameter is itself not a perfect square then -1 should be
      returned. You may assume the parameter is non-negative.
