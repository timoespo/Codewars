    <title>Codewars Solution 0193 - Sum of Array Singles</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      You will be given an array of numbers in which two numbers occur once and
      the rest occur only twice. Your task will be to return the sum of the
      numbers that occur only once. For example, repeats([4,5,7,5,4,8]) = 15
      because only the numbers 7 and 8 occur once, and their sum is 15. Every
      other number occurs twice.
