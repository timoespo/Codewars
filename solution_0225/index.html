    <title>Codewars Solution 0225 - Convert String to Camel Case</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited
      words into camel casing. The first word within the output should be
      capitalized only if the original word was capitalized (known as Upper
      Camel Case, also often referred to as Pascal case). The next words should
      be always capitalized.
