    <title>Codewars Solution 0117 - Make a Function That Does Arithmetic</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      Given two numbers and an arithmetic operator (the name of it, as a
      string), return the result of the two numbers having that operator used on
      them. a and b will both be positive integers, and a will always be the
      first number in the operation, and b always the second. The four operators
      are "add", "subtract", "divide", "multiply". A few examples:(Input1,
      Input2, Input3 --> Output) 5, 2, "add" --> 7 5, 2, "subtract" --> 3 5, 2,
      "multiply" --> 10 5, 2, "divide" --> 2.5
