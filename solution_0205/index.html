    <p>
      You will be given an array of objects (associative arrays in PHP)
      representing data about developers who have signed up to attend the next
      coding meetup that you are organising. The list is ordered according to
      who signed up first. Your task is to return one of the following strings:
      < firstName here >, < country here > of the first Python developer who has
      signed up; or There will be no Python developers if no Python developer
      has signed up.
