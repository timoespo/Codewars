    <title>Codewars Solution 0156 - Find the Vowels</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      We want to know the index of the vowels in a given word, for example,
      there are two vowels in the word super (the second and fourth letters). So
      given a string "super", we should return a list of [2, 4]. Some examples:
      Mmmm => [] Super => [2,4] Apple => [1,5] YoMama -> [1,2,4,6] NOTES Vowels
      in this context refers to: a e i o u y (including upper case) This is
      indexed from [1..n] (not zero indexed!)
