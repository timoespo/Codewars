    <title>Codewars Solution 0250 - Mexican Wave</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      The wave (known as the Mexican wave in the English-speaking world outside
      North America) is an example of metachronal rhythm achieved in a packed
      stadium when successive groups of spectators briefly stand, yell, and
      raise their arms. Immediately upon stretching to full height, the
      spectator returns to the usual seated position. The result is a wave of
      standing spectators that travels through the crowd, even though individual
      spectators never move away from their seats. In many large arenas the
      crowd is seated in a contiguous circuit all the way around the sport
      field, and so the wave is able to travel continuously around the arena; in
      discontiguous seating arrangements, the wave can instead reflect back and
      forth through the crowd. When the gap in seating is narrow, the wave can
      sometimes pass through it. Usually only one wave crest will be present at
      any given time in an arena, although simultaneous, counter-rotating waves
      have been produced.
