    <title>Codewars Solution 0221 - Replace With Alphabet Position</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      In this kata you are required to, given a string, replace every letter
      with its position in the alphabet. If anything in the text isn't a letter,
      ignore it and don't return it. "a" = 1, "b" = 2, etc.
