    <title>Codewars Solution 0257 - Rectangle into Squares</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      The drawing below gives an idea of how to cut a given "true" rectangle
      into squares ("true" rectangle meaning that the two dimensions are
      different). Can you translate this drawing into an algorithm? You will be
      given two dimensions a positive integer length a positive integer width
      You will return a collection or a string (depending on the language; Shell
      bash, PowerShell, Pascal and Fortran return a string) with the size of
      each of the squares.
