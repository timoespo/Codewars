    <p>
      The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence
      (Fn): 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, ... such as F(n)
      = F(n-1) + F(n-2) with F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1. Given a number, say prod
      (for product), we search two Fibonacci numbers F(n) and F(n+1) verifying
      F(n) * F(n+1) = prod.
