  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      In a small town the population is p0 = 1000 at the beginning of a year.
      The population regularly increases by 2 percent per year and moreover 50
      new inhabitants per year come to live in the town. How many years does the
      town need to see its population greater or equal to p = 1200 inhabitants?
    </p>
    <p>
      More generally given parameters: p0, percent, aug (inhabitants coming or
      leaving each year), p (population to equal or surpass) the function
      nb_year should return n number of entire years needed to get a population
      greater or equal to p. aug is an integer, percent a positive or null
      floating number, p0 and p are positive integers (> 0)
