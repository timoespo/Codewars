  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      You are the greatest chef on earth. No one boils eggs like you! Your
      restaurant is always full of guests, who love your boiled eggs. But when
      there is a greater order of boiled eggs, you need some time, because you
      have only one pot for your job. How much time do you need? Your Task
      Implement a function, which takes a non-negative integer, representing the
      number of eggs to boil. It must return the time in minutes (integer),
      which it takes to have all the eggs boiled. Rules you can put at most 8
      eggs into the pot at once it takes 5 minutes to boil an egg we assume,
      that the water is boiling all the time (no time to heat up) for simplicity
      we also don't consider the time it takes to put eggs into the pot or get
      them out of it
