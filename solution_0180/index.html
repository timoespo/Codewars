    <p>
      You will be given an array of objects (associative arrays in PHP, tables
      in COBOL) representing data about developers who have signed up to attend
      the next coding meetup that you are organising. Your task is to return an
      array where each object will have a new property 'greeting' with the
      following string value: Hi < firstName here >, what do you like the most
      about < language here >?
