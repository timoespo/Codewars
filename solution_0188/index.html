    <title>Codewars Solution 0188 - Leap Year</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      In this kata you should simply determine, whether a given year is a leap
      year or not. In case you don't know the rules, here they are: years
      divisible by 4 are leap years but years divisible by 100 are not leap
      years but years divisible by 400 are leap years Additional Notes: Only
      valid years (positive integers) will be tested, so you don't have to
      validate them
