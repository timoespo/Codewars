    <title>Codewars Solution 0212 - Multiples of 3 or 5</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5,
      we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Finish the
      solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below
      the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0
      (for languages that do have them). Note: If the number is a multiple of
      both 3 and 5, only count it once.
