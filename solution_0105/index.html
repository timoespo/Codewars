      The museum of incredible dull things The museum of incredible dull things
      wants to get rid of some exhibitions. Miriam, the interior architect,
      comes up with a plan to remove the most boring exhibitions. She gives them
      a rating, and then removes the one with the lowest rating. However, just
      as she finished rating all exhibitions, she's off to an important fair, so
      she asks you to write a program that tells her the ratings of the items
      after one removed the lowest one. Fair enough. Task Given an array of
      integers, remove the smallest value. Do not mutate the original
      array/list. If there are multiple elements with the same value, remove the
      one with a lower index. If you get an empty array/list, return an empty
      array/list. Don't change the order of the elements that are left.
