    <title>Codewars Solution 0224 - Tribonacci Sequence</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      Well met with Fibonacci bigger brother, AKA Tribonacci. As the name may
      already reveal, it works basically like a Fibonacci, but summing the last
      3 (instead of 2) numbers of the sequence to generate the next. And, worse
      part of it, regrettably I won't get to hear non-native Italian speakers
      trying to pronounce it :( So, if we are to start our Tribonacci sequence
      with [1, 1, 1] as a starting input (AKA signature), we have this sequence:
      [1, 1 ,1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31, ...]
