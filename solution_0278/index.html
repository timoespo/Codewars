    <title>Codewars Solution 0278 - Directions Reduction</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      Once upon a time, on a way through the old wild mountainous west,… … a man
      was given directions to go from one point to another. The directions were
      "NORTH", "SOUTH", "WEST", "EAST". Clearly "NORTH" and "SOUTH" are
      opposite, "WEST" and "EAST" too. Going to one direction and coming back
      the opposite direction right away is a needless effort. Since this is the
      wild west, with dreadful weather and not much water, it's important to
      save yourself some energy, otherwise you might die of thirst!
