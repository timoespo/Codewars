    <p>
      Create a function taking a positive integer between 1 and 3999 (both
      included) as its parameter and returning a string containing the Roman
      Numeral representation of that integer. Modern Roman numerals are written
      by expressing each digit separately starting with the left most digit and
      skipping any digit with a value of zero. In Roman numerals 1990 is
      rendered: 1000=M, 900=CM, 90=XC; resulting in MCMXC. 2008 is written as
      2000=MM, 8=VIII; or MMVIII. 1666 uses each Roman symbol in descending
      order: MDCLXVI.
