    <title>Codewars Solution 0292 - Bouncing Balls</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      A child is playing with a ball on the nth floor of a tall building. The
      height of this floor above ground level, h, is known. He drops the ball
      out of the window. The ball bounces (for example), to two-thirds of its
      height (a bounce of 0.66). His mother looks out of a window 1.5 meters
      from the ground. How many times will the mother see the ball pass in front
      of her window including when it's falling and bouncing?
