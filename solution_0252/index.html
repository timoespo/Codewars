    <title>Codewars Solution 0252 - Two Sum</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      Write a function that takes an array of numbers (integers for the tests)
      and a target number. It should find two different items in the array that,
      when added together, give the target value. The indices of these items
      should then be returned in a tuple / list (depending on your language)
      like so: (index1, index2). For the purposes of this kata, some tests may
      have multiple answers; any valid solutions will be accepted. The input
      will always be valid (numbers will be an array of length 2 or greater, and
      all of the items will be numbers; target will always be the sum of two
      different items from that array).
