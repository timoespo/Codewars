    <p>
      My grandfather always predicted how old people would get, and right before
      he passed away he revealed his secret! In honor of my grandfather's memory
      we will write a function using his formula! Take a list of ages when each
      of your great-grandparent died. Multiply each number by itself. Add them
      all together. Take the square root of the result. Divide by two.
