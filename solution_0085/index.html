    <title>Codewars Solution 0085 - Complementary DNA</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    pDeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and
    carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living
    organisms. If you want to know more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA In DNA
    strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G".
    Your function receives one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you
    need to return the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or
    there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).
