    <title>Codewars Solution 0176 - Sort the Gift Code</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      Happy Holidays fellow Code Warriors! Santa's senior gift organizer Elf
      developed a way to represent up to 26 gifts by assigning a unique
      alphabetical character to each gift. After each gift was assigned a
      character, the gift organizer Elf then joined the characters to form the
      gift ordering code. Santa asked his organizer to order the characters in
      alphabetical order, but the Elf fell asleep from consuming too much hot
      chocolate and candy canes! Can you help him out? Sort the Gift Code Write
      a function called sortGiftCode/sort_gift_code/SortGiftCode that accepts a
      string containing up to 26 unique alphabetical characters, and returns a
      string containing the same characters in alphabetical order.
