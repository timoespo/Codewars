      Codewars Solution 0170- Convert an array of strings to array of numbers
    </title>
  </head>

    <p>
      Some really funny web dev gave you a sequence of numbers from his API
      response as an sequence of strings! You need to cast the whole array to
      the correct type. Create the function that takes as a parameter a sequence
      of numbers represented as strings and outputs a sequence of numbers.
      ie:["1", "2", "3"] to [1, 2, 3] Note that you can receive floats as well.
