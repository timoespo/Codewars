    <p>
      You will be given an array of objects (associative arrays in PHP)
      representing data about developers who have signed up to attend the next
      coding meetup that you are organising. Your task is to return: true if at
      least one Ruby developer has signed up; or false if there will be no Ruby
      developers.
