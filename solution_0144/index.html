    <p>
      If a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 ... z = 26 Then l + o + v + e = 54 and f + r + i +
      e + n + d + s + h + i + p = 108 So friendship is twice as strong as love
      :-) Your task is to write a function which calculates the value of a word
      based off the sum of the alphabet positions of its characters. The input
      will always be made of only lowercase letters and will never be empty.
