  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      Winter is coming, you must prepare your ski holidays. The objective of
      this kata is to determine the number of pair of gloves you can constitute
      from the gloves you have in your drawer. Given an array describing the
      color of each glove, return the number of pairs you can constitute,
      assuming that only gloves of the same color can form pairs.
