    <p>Character recognition software is widely used to digitise printed texts. Thus the texts can be edited, searched and stored on a computer.
        When documents (especially pretty old ones written with a typewriter), are digitised character recognition softwares often make mistakes.
        Your task is correct the errors in the digitised text. You only have to handle the following mistakes:
        S is misinterpreted as 5
        O is misinterpreted as 0
        I is misinterpreted as 1
        The test cases contain numbers only by mistake.</p>
