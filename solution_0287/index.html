    <p>
      Let's pretend your company just hired your friend from college and paid
      you a referral bonus. Awesome! To celebrate, you're taking your team out
      to the terrible dive bar next door and using the referral bonus to buy,
      and build, the largest three-dimensional beer can pyramid you can. And
      then probably drink those beers, because let's pretend it's Friday too.
