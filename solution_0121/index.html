    <p>
      The two oldest ages function/method needs to be completed. It should take
      an array of numbers as its argument and return the two highest numbers
      within the array. The returned value should be an array in the format
      [second oldest age, oldest age]. The order of the numbers passed in could
      be any order. The array will always include at least 2 items. If there are
      two or more oldest age, then return both of them in array format.
