    <p>
      Are the numbers in order? In this Kata, your function receives an array of
      integers as input. Your task is to determine whether the numbers are in
      ascending order. An array is said to be in ascending order if there are no
      two adjacent integers where the left integer exceeds the right integer in
      value. For the purposes of this Kata, you may assume that all inputs are
      valid, i.e. arrays containing only integers. Note that an array of 0 or 1
      integer(s) is automatically considered to be sorted in ascending order
      since all (zero) adjacent pairs of integers satisfy the condition that the
      left integer does not exceed the right integer in value.
