      Mr. Scrooge has a sum of money 'P' that he wants to invest. Before he
      does, he wants to know how many years 'Y' this sum 'P' has to be kept in
      the bank in order for it to amount to a desired sum of money 'D'. The sum
      is kept for 'Y' years in the bank where interest 'I' is paid yearly. After
      paying taxes 'T' for the year the new sum is re-invested. Note to Tax: not
      the invested principal is taxed, but only the year's accrued interest
