      novice/average/experienced/professional/world-famous Web Developer (choose
      one) who owns a(n)
      simple/clean/slick/beautiful/complicated/professional/business website
      (choose one or more) which contains form fields so visitors can send
      emails or leave a comment on your website with ease. However, with ease
      comes danger. Every now and then, a hacker visits your website and
      attempts to compromise it through the use of XSS (Cross Site Scripting).
      This is done by injecting script tags into the website through form fields
      which may contain malicious code (e.g. a redirection to a malicious
      website that steals personal information). Mission Your mission is to
      implement a function that converts the following potentially harmful
      characters: < --> &lt; > --> &gt; " --> &quot; & --> &amp;
