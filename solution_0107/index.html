    <title>Codewars Solution 0107 - The highest profit wins!</title>

    <p>
      Story Ben has a very simple idea to make some profit: he buys something
      and sells it again. Of course, this wouldn't give him any profit at all if
      he was simply to buy and sell it at the same price. Instead, he's going to
      buy it for the lowest possible price and sell it at the highest. Task
      Write a function that returns both the minimum and maximum number of the
      given list/array.
