    <title>Codewars Solution 0174 - Power of Two</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      Complete the function power_of_two/powerOfTwo (or equivalent, depending on
      your language) that determines if a given non-negative integer is a power
      of two. From the corresponding Wikipedia entry: a power of two is a number
      of the form 2n where n is an integer, i.e. the result of exponentiation
      with number two as the base and integer n as the exponent. You may assume
      the input is always valid.
