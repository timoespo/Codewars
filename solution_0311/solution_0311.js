// In mathematics, Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients

// where n denotes a row of the triangle, and k is a position of a term in the row.

// Pascal's Triangle

// You can read Wikipedia article on Pascal's Triangle for more information.

// Task
// Write a function that, given a depth n, returns n top rows of Pascal's Triangle flattened into a one-dimensional list/array.

// Example:
// n = 1: [1]
// n = 2: [1,  1, 1]
// n = 4: [1,  1, 1,  1, 2, 1,  1, 3, 3, 1]
